# Project Brief

## Core Objective

The primary goal of this project is to analyze the existing codebase to determine its compatibility for deployment on Vercel.

## Key Questions to Answer

1.  What is the technology stack of the application?
2.  Are there any specific configurations or dependencies that might conflict with the Vercel environment?
3.  What are the build and deployment processes?
4.  Are there any environment variables or secrets that need to be managed?
5.  Does the application have any server-side components that might require special handling on Vercel?
